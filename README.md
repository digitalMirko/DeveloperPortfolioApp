Android Developer Portfolio App

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'Developer Portfolio App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a title ('Developer Portfolio App')on the top. Then right below is shown the developers name with a brief
introduction of his skills. On the right of the text is a photo of the developer in a circle image shape (using a github plugin)
in a colored box. In the bottom of the box is a button with an option to click and call the developer directly on the mobile device
via a telephone. Right below are a number of tabs: About, Work, Skills and Contact.

When clicked each tab will display information corresponding to the clicked tab. The 'About' tab is a place that gives a brief introduction
of who the developer is. The 'Work' tab shows various apps developed by the developer. The 'Skills' tab shows the various skills
the developer has to offer. The 'Contact' tab shows another photo of the developer and some online contact options. All of the tabs have
information displayed in CardViews. The tabs themselves are created from blank Fragments with the correct information added.
